No longer do I need my alarm; my very instinct, something deep within, tells me when it is time to awake. Gathering my surfboard, a swimsuit, and other necessary equipment, I step outside and pause at the bottom of the stairs. Listening intently, I realize that the shouts from the amusement parks have not started, and the noise of civilization has yet to arrive. Everything is virtually silent save the waves crashing in a location just beyond my view and the summer gulls trying to collect their food for the day.",

The worst part is the lines take forever, so by the time you sit down, you barely have time to eat. I usually bring snacks just in case, because I never know if I’ll like what they serve. I think they should give more choices so people don’t waste food.",

Some teachers act like phones are the biggest problem ever, but they can actually help if you need to look something up fast. The real issue is people being on TikTok or texting during lessons. If students had a rule like “phones face down unless the teacher says,” it would be fair. Taking phones away completely just makes people more sneaky.",

The sun, the very light of the world, begins to make its appearance over the distant, ever-present yet mysterious horizon. It is almost as though a giant light switch has been flipped on as glorious rays of silken purples, radiant pinks and delicate blues shine bright. The sun’s likeness reflects off of the vast ocean waters in front of me, and, despite its blinding qualities, it is mesmerizing. I do not blink at all, for fear I will miss a single second of the sight that is far too beautiful for words: something beyond mere mortal comprehension.",

They knew that life is not about the fabric you weave but the dreams you create, not about the change that occurs when straw is spun into gold but the metamorphosis of the human spirit. Mamo has just turned sixty-nine years old and is full of vitality and light. In the letters I write to her on her birthday and each Mother’s Day, I liken her to splendid objects such as Mexican ceramics or a flock of butterflies. She wields a brilliant magic – one that allowed a heartbroken sharecropper’s daughter to take silk and tresses, joy and love, and form the life she wanted and the family she treasures. And as much as any child she has raised or any dress she has sewn, she herself is truly a masterpiece.",

It was a wonderful atmosphere—a place where I could worship the God I loved and enjoy the company of the people who seemed like me—not externally, but internally. As I continued to return to the Chinese church, a lot of my “friends” made fun of me. They called me an “inverse Twinkie,” a clever racial slur referring to Caucasian people who are under the impression that they’re Asian. I simply smiled and played along. I found that I cared less and less what they thought—I had discovered a place I loved, a place I belonged, and I was happy. The reason I fit in so well with the youth group was a bit oblique at first, but eventually it became obvious to me. They’re scholarly people, intelligent; they love God and have a knack for computers—which also happens to be a perfect description of myself. I climbed out of bed and got dressed. I was sore from the previous night’s festivities—nothing quite like Frisbee Football, or Ultimate Frisbee as my Oriental friends had dubbed the game. I smiled to myself as I walked down the dimly-lit hallways of the campus. “I am at home,” I thought.",

They might also tell of the times they served to replace the ripped cloth boots from my roller blades. Perhaps, though, they would just complain about being neglected of late, in favor of the two newer pairs of softer, less itchy wool-blends; the ones that talk of churches, and also speak of sandals. Or maybe they would fault the black, thick dress wools with the elastic all stretched out (they have tales to tell about frigid marching band shows with the cuffs of the flannel pants I wore under my uniform tucked in so they wouldn’t show) for being part of what has kept me from camping and skating for the last four years.",

The youth at my parent’s church seemed to me the perfect stereotype of teenagers—no ambition, only caring about the moment, and doing everything for the sole purpose of fitting in.

    "text":" We started the day with Atlas’ producer of the day presentation on Sophie, which was really interesting and gave us all a deep dive into how much influence she had on the music scene. Today was a particularly exciting day, as it was the first time we started the DJing part of our M-Term. We were once again joined by Mr. Trevino, who not only taught us the basics of the skill itself but also gave us insights into his lifestyle and career as a DJ. We all downloaded Serato DJ Lite, a free DJing software that allowed us to take two songs and mash them up with our expert's guidance. We learned how to download and input songs, how to match tempos (beats per minute) and key signatures, and finally, how to mix volumes in order to properly transition between songs. We had the chance to download our own songs and experiment with the different elements that determined whether songs were compatible or not in creating an enjoyable auditory experience. I originally attempted “Black Star” by Radiohead and “Your Latest Trick” by Dire Straits, which proved to be a disaster due to extremely different tempos. We also all had the opportunity to use two smaller pieces of equipment for DJing, and got to try a larger piece of equipment owned by Mr. Trevino which was a lot of fun and much more intuitive than working solely on the computer.",

Everyone was hard at work researching their topics, and after a 10-minute break at around 11, everyone took turns giving brief explanations of their topics, with characteristics such as Tempo, Rhythm, Tonality, Melody, etc… Afterwards, we spent the rest of the day working to create a song of that genre, where a few people presented what they had.

We all had so much fun finding unique sounds to input into our music and enjoyed sharing our (sometimes questionable) creations with each other. Once it was time for lunch, Mr Roddy drove us to our first record store of the term, Sig’s Lagoon, where we spent at least half an hour scouring through the countless vinyls and even making some purchases. We made a pit stop to Levy Park to eat our lunch and rest before we went to get some ice cream at Amy’s. Finally, we went to our second record store, Cactus Music, where we found (and bought) so many cool music-related items. We headed back to school to enjoy some time together and share our findings, making for a perfect ending to an already great day. ",
